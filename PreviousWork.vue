        <p>SIT102: In this unit I primarily used C++ as the programming language. As this was a first year class, it could mostly be considered as an introductory unit where I briefly learnt about the basics of C++. In the unit, I did a range of things, such as user prompted tasks, arrays and structs, as well as simple game creation.

        <p>SIT112: In this unit, the main programming language is python. Being a first year unit, it was also quite introductory however did get difficult pretty quickly as the unit went on, especially during the end of unit group task. This unit consisted mainly of the usage of jupyter notebook, which I no longer have access to, meaning I cannot display anything about it.

        SIT182: This unit primarily was about learning about different ways the new age criminals cyber-attack their innocent victims, showing the different methods they utilize to commit crimes and scam/attack others.

        <p>SIT223: SIT223 was not exactly a unit based off of trying to learn a new programming language or working on pre-learnt skills and as such advancing them, but rather working on the professional development in order to allow for an individual to ready for the real work force that is waiting for them outside and after their university degree.</p>

      <div class="work-item">
        <p>SIT232: This unit utilized another C language, C#. Debugging was one of the major themes that was seen throughout the entirety of this unit, with every single piece of code added to the portfolio, it had to be understood on how to debug the code. Topics such as polymorphism, arrays and lists as well as inheritance were standout activities for this unit.</p>
